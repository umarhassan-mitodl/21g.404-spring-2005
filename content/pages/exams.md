Exam Information
----------------

1.  Two hour-long written tests focus on individual student expression in two main sections: a) construction of sentences using the specific vocabulary and grammatical structures that have been analyzed and practiced in class discussion of a variety of authentic printed and video texts, including literary and documentary texts; b) short essays in the form of description, interpretation, and discussion that draw on class work with texts.
2.  Four vocabulary quizzes echo the format of the daily 5-item vocabulary lists based on the material for class discussion compiled by individual students for the class \[Vokabelarbeit ({{% resource_link d824e984-a9ce-eb64-0c1d-72f96b3aba2c "PDF" %}}), Sample Student List ({{% resource_link 274a970c-80d5-dbf9-004c-16bcb2c3d344 "PDF" %}})\]. For each quiz based on 30-35 items, students choose 5-6 words/phrases from a pre-selected list of 10-12 and provide for each the appropriate syntactical and semantic information and an original sentence that illustrates appropriate use \[Sample Vocabulary Test ({{% resource_link 334f87bf-544e-a529-1125-d45ff6fdd7af "PDF" %}})\].
3.  Five-minute oral presentation of an area of particular personal interest and experience. Students prepare an outline for the presentation (see {{% resource_link 36d8d228-2d2a-04a0-4470-cf4361263ad5 "Referat" %}} under assignments) and speak from their notes without reading. Evaluation is on the basis of clarity, structure, idiomatic use of language, delivery, interest-level of content.
